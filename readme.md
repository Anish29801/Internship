## 📂 Project Overview

This repository is a **learning + development workspace** that contains three main parts:

- **JavaScript (`js/`)** → Practice scripts, algorithms, and Node.js utilities.  
- **TypeScript (`ts/`)** → Strongly typed projects, OOP concepts, and type-safe applications.  
- **React (`react/`)** → Frontend applications using modern React (Hooks, Components, State Management).  

It is designed for developers who want to **learn, practice, and compare** different technologies in one place.
